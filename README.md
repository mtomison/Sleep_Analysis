I wanted to make sure I understand my duties before its too late. according to the curriculum the shapes should shift, and i think i tag jordon out. 
Can you please verify this or correct it if needed. Below is an outline format of information, There is some stuff I dont know the answer to so I left it easy to edit. Add more questions that anyone needs answered.  Sections that need followup are below including Description of the communication protocols, Provisional machine learning mode, and Provisional\Database. can anyone try to help complete those?

# Sleep_Analysis

How well rested will I be?

## Overview
This project analyzes sleep data collected from Sleep Cycle iOS App in order to determine what contributes to good sleep. Factors examined are caffeine consumption, physical activity, heart rate, and length of time sleeping. We will use machine learning models to predictt if a person will have good or poor sleep based on these factors.

## Description of the communication protocols:
README.md must include:
✓ Description of the communication protocols Individual Branches
✓ At least one branch for each team member
✓ Each team member has at least four commits from the duration of the first segment


## Provisional machine learning mode:
Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
RandomForest



## Provisional\Database:
Team members present a provisional\database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the
following:

✓ Sample data that mimics theexpected final database structure or schema
✓ Draft machine learning module isconnected to the provisional database
