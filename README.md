At first we thought to have two ML models, one to predict the users mood and one to predict the sleep quality. Instead of users entering a value for the sleep quality, we would try and predict it based off the length of time in bed. However after trying out several models, I couldn't find one that had an accuracy so we decided instead to have one ML model to predict the sleep quality using all of the data points. 

# Sleep_Analysis

How well rested will I be?

## Overview
This project analyzes sleep data collected from Sleep Cycle iOS App in order to determine what contributes to good sleep. Factors examined are caffeine consumption, physical activity, heart rate, and length of time sleeping. We will use machine learning models to predictt if a person will have good or poor sleep based on these factors.
